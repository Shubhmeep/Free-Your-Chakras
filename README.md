## Introduction

A discipline used to bring harmony and peace to both our mind and body is known as Yoga. Yoga originated in ancient India almost about 5000 years ago. Heavily shaken by the corona pandemic, it is necessary to include yoga in our daily lifestyle, but it is difficult for children having severe chronic systemic conditions due to their disabilities to embrace this lifestyle. 
A study was conducted on 70 children aged 10-15 years from a school for the intellectually challenged situated in Pune, Maharashtra. Half of them were made to do a particular set of yogic training exercises 5 hours every week for 12 weeks along with their regular schooling and the other half were not exposed to any yogic training exercises, there was a highly significant improvement in the IQ of children who performed yoga. 
This study showed that performing yogic exercises can be an effective therapeutic tool in the conditional improvement of mentally retarded children. Therefore technologies like image processing and machine learning can be used to develop an application that can assist in the improvement and development of such children, which can be accessed and used by anyone who wishes to develop a skill in yoga for both recreational as well as therapeutic purposes.
